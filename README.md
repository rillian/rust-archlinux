# Building rust on archlinux

This is a quick docker container description for building the
latest version of the rust programming language on the Arch
Linux distribution.

To run, do something like:

```
docker build -t rust-archlinux .
docker run rust-archlinux
```

Some systems require `sudo` before any docker command.

Comments welcome, and good luck!
